Linear Equation Class

Instance Variables:
    private int x-one - This variable represents the first x variable
    private int y-one - This variable represents the first y variable
    private int x-two - this represents the second x variable
    private int y-two - this represents the second y variable

Contructor:
    // Uses 4 parameters for each coordinate value
    public LinearEquation(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2){}

Methods:
    public String getCoordinateOne()
    - This method will return the first coordinate that was input by the user
    - return String coordinateOne

    public String getCoordinateTwo()
    - This method will return the second coordinate that was input by the user
    - return String coordinateTwo

    public String getValues()
    - This method will use String methods like substrings to isolate the x and y values from the
      coordinates into their own variable
    - Since they are still strings, they'll need to be converted to int with Integer parseInt

    public double getSlope()
    - This method will use the slope formula (y2-y1)/(x2-x1), to find and return the slope of
      the two coordinates
    - return double Slope

    public int getIntercept()
    - This method will return the y-intercept by using the slope formula by plugging in one of the y
      values and x values with the slope to find b
    - return int Intercept

    public String getEquation()
    - this method will return the slope intercept equation y=mx+b
    - return String slopeEquation

    public double getDistance()
    - This method will return the distance between the two coordinates
    - It will subtract the y values, then it would subtract the x values to get the A and B values
    - Then it will use the equation a^2 + b^2 = c^2 to find the distance
    - return double Distance

    public String toString()
    This method will display all the information about the instance including
    - X and Y coordinates of both inputs by the user
    - Slope intercept form equation
    - Slope of line
    - Y-intercept of line
    - Distance between points

    public Int thirdCoordinate()
    - This method will return the y value when the third x value in input

    public String finalCoordinate()
    - This method will create a string that combines the first third value and new y value and format it
      in parenthesis
    - return coordinate





EquationRunner.java

Add scanner class
add format for decimal points
create variables for coordinate1, coordinate2, xValue

Step 1 - Ask user for first coordinate
Step 2 - Ask use for second coordinate
Step 3 - Use toString method to print all the information (coordinates, slope, intercept, distance)
Step 4 - ask for third x value
Step 5 - Print the new coordinate
